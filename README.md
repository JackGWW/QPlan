# QPlan

QPlan is a web app created to simplify the course planning process for Queen's University Engineering Students.
It build along with Jack Naylor (@JackJNaylor) and Caron Cook (@CarsonCook) for our 4th year Capstone project. 

The live application is available over the Queen's VPN at _qplan.engineering.queensu.ca_.  Information about the VPN can be found here: https://www.queensu.ca/its/networks/virtual-private-network-vpn

This repository contains just the front-end code (for which I was the primary contributor), will all connections to the backend removed. 


### Motivation
Students studying engineering at Queen’s University have rigorous requirements that they must complete to graduate as an accredited engineer. There are mandatory courses, specified amounts of credits, five different accreditation units that must be obtained, and requirements on how many courses to take from different lists. To ensure they will graduate, students must look through several different Queen’s websites and documents, use an Excel spreadsheet, and work with the SOLUS program to plan which courses they will take. This is a convoluted, difficult, and timely process that leads to many issues, some of which are described below.

Due to the difficulty in planning courses, students often don’t make informed enrollment choices and instead choose courses similar to what their friends are taking. This limits the breadth of knowledge in their degree, especially with respect to their non-technical electives. Students may be unable to enroll in their preferred upper year courses because they did not plan for the required prerequisite courses. These issues with course planning add a significant burden to students, making them unnecessarily stressed about their course choices during the enrollment periods. 


### Development 
The front-end UI was build using Vue.js and the Vuetify component framework.
