The principles arising from First and Second laws of thermodynamics will be applied to the solution of mass, energy, and entropy balances for homogeneous closed and open systems. Properties of ideal gases and real fluids will be derived from Equations of State and applied in the analysis of simple flow processes. The students will compute efficiencies and coefficients of performance for energy production, conversion, and storage systems. The impacts of energy process design choices on efficiency, performance, and sustainability will be measured through exergy analysis.",

The steps of controller development are treated: process characterization (using mathematical models), controller design, and implementation. Methods for assessing system stability and performance are investigated, and are used in the design of controllers. Frequency response methods are introduced, as is the development and implementation of controller enhancements including feedforward and cascade control.",

The principal topics covered include identification of the driving forces for heat and mass diffusion, development of transport models from first principles, steady state and transient solutions, and convective transfer. The boundary layer analogies are introduced. Closed form analytical solutions and correlations derived from dimensional analysis are used to estimate the heat and mass transfer convection coefficients.",

Heat and mass transfer knowledge is applied in the analysis and design of unit operations, including separation processes and heat exchanging equipment. The equilibrium stage concept is used to perform calculations and size separation processes including distillation, gas absorption/stripping and liquid-liquid extraction. Heat transfer processes are taught with an emphasis on the design various types of heat exchanging equipment, including shell and tube heat exchangers, condensers and reboilers. The chemical process design component of the course involves a series of activities, dealing with the design of separation processes, heat exchanger sizing and design, process hazards analysis, implementation of instrumentation and construction of piping and instrument diagrams. In addition to choosing and sizing unit operations and implementing appropriate process instrumentation, the students will learn to use simulation tools and will incorporate economics, safety and environmental responsibility in all stages of the design.

        "description": "This is a course about innovation  distinctive ideas, of value, put to practice  and entrepreneurship  the process of putting to practice and sustaining the implementation of innovations  for societal benefit and wealth creation. Curiosity of the world around us is emphasized for identifying opportunities to have an impact and make a difference, to which a discipline is imposed - one that identifies who  might be interested in or benefit from our product or service, and how we can bring an idea to fruition and bring the necessary resources (e.g., financial, intellectual) to provide it to society. Legal aspects (e.g., incorporation, partnerships), raising capital, and protecting the strategic advantage of intellectual property (e.g., patents, trade secrets) are discussed, together with the importance of having a social acceptance to operate. The concept of a business model, summarized using the business model canvas methodology, is presented, together with the concept of a business plan describing how a venture will be operated over a time horizon. For-profit and not-for-profit ventures, and the elements of the business models for each, are studied and compared, and intrapreneurship/entrepreneurship are compared. Financial metrics for assessing the viability of ventures and guiding investment decisions are reviewed. Systems Thinking (recognizing the whole/parts and that which is common/distinct) is introduced. Design Thinking  a human-centered design emphasizing observation and insight - is presented, along with journey maps and personas for understanding customer segments. Diffusion of innovations is described, including the factors influencing adoption of innovations, and the manner in which innovations propagate in society. Working in groups, students identify a venture opportunity having a technological component, and propose a business model and plan as the major evaluation in the course. The transport phenomena approach is followed to study and analyze transport of momentum, energy and mass, with special focus on combined transport problems. Solutions are developed for problems involving steady-state and unsteady flows, isothermal and non-isothermal conditions, as well as non-Newtonian liquids. This course completes the students' intellectual training in the transport sciences culminating in their mastery of combined transport problems, including fluid flow with heat transfer, or mass transport with fluid flow, or heat transfer with mass transport.",

Assessment of biodegradability; biostimulation vs bioaugmentation; mineralization vs. partial degradation; factors affecting microbial activity (choice of electron acceptor, toxicity of pollutant, C/N/P ratio, co-substrates, soil humidity, pH and temperature); bioavailability of pollutant. Biodegradation of specific contaminants (e.g. diesel fuel, polychlorinated biphenyls, dyestuffs, aromatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons) will be studied in detail. The design component of this course consists of learning design of appropriate laboratory and field experiments to obtain data on microbial degradation of an organic pollutant to be able to calculate bioremediation design parameters such as mass and delivery rate requirements of electron acceptors and nutrients and degradation rates in reactor and non-reactor based systems; and to be aware of limitations of these calculations.",

In this course, students will first learn about problem definition and impact analysis from economic standpoint as well as other perspectives. They will then learn different design principles, management techniques, and development methodologies. Next, students will learn about culture and communication in teams, followed by important concepts in ethics and intellectual property. Students will practice these notions in the context of mini-projects and lab activities. Additionally, specific software and tools that are available for facilitating these concepts will be introduced and utilized throughout the term. Finally, students will form groups and formulate a project plan. They will then prepare a proposal document that describes their project including the problem, impact, solution overview, projected costs, risks, milestones, and tentative schedule for the following academic year. The groups will execute their plans in ELEC 49x in the subsequent year (however, students going away on internship must join up to form new groups upon their return).",

This includes development of the strain energy release rate (GIC) and the critical stress intensity factor (KIC). Emphasis will be placed on developing the correlation between microstructure control and the resistance to crack propagation which this variable produces. Dislocation theory will be evoked to analyze the stress fields of point, line and plane defects. Plasticity and fracture will be detailed, which includes the time dependent aspects of such processes as static fatigue and creep fracture.",

The courses start with an introduction to the structure and properties of different polymers. The mechanics of polymers are covered including elasticity, rubber elasticity, pressure dependent yield and viscoelasticity. The mechanics of composites depend not only on the matrix, but also on the reinforcing phase. While focussing on polymer composites, metal and ceramic-based composites will also be introduced. Topics covered will include the influence of the interface, mechanical and transport properties and design of composites. The final goal is to correlate constitutive relations describing the time-temperature dependence of mechanical properties of polymers and composites to microstructure and linking these relations to practical design.",

        "description": "The majority of conventional materials have grain or crystallite sizes ranging from micrometers to several millimeters. Capabilities now exist to synthesize materials with grains where one or more dimension is on the nanoscale (less than 100 nm). As the grain size decreases, there is a significant increase in the volume fraction of grain boundaries or interfaces. This characteristic strongly influences the chemical and physical properties of the materials. For example, nanostructured ceramics are tougher and stronger than coarser grained ceramics, while nanostructured metals exhibit increases in yield strength and elastic modulus. It has also been shown that other properties (e.g. electrical, optical and magnetic) are influenced by a fine grain structure. The goal of this course is to introduce the student to the impact of length scale, from millimeter to nanometer, on material properties, with a primary but not exclusive focus on mechanical properties. It will include discussions on synethesis approaches as well as examples of applications.",

        "description": "A nuclear reactor presents a unique environment in which materials must perform. In addition to the high temperatures and stresses to which materials are subjected in conventional applications, nuclear materials are subjected to various kinds of radiation which affect their performance, and often this dictates a requirement for a unique property (for example, a low cross section for thermal neutron absorption) that is not relevant in conventional applications. The effects of the radiation may be direct (e.g., the displacement of atoms form their normal positions by fast neutrons or fission fragments), or indirect (e.g., a more aggressive chemical environment caused by radiolytic decomposition). This course describes materials and structures typically used in nuclear environments, their manufacture, the unique conditions to which they are subjected, the basic physical phenomena that affect their performance and the resulting design and operational requirements for reactor components. The course includes a field trips to components manufacturers and to Canada's national nuclear research laboratory.",

The course covers the structure of human joints, including experimental and analytical techniques in the study of human joint kinematics; applications to the design of artificial joints and to clinical diagnosis and treatments. Students are introduced to the motion capabilities of the human body and how to develop and study kinematic models of the individual joints of the human body. Experimental methods used to collect kinematic data will be studied through interactive labs. Topics include defining body position and displacement, three dimensional representation of human motion, basic functional anatomy of individual joints, rigid body kinematics (homogeneous transformations, Euler angles, helical axis), intrajoint kinematics, joint modelling, articular surface motion. Three-dimensional kinematics of individual joints is emphasized from the perspective of total joint replacement design.",

Topics covered include rheological behaviour of rocks, stress measurement and prediction, and measurement procedures for determination of rock strength and other characteristic parameters. Failure theories are discussed and used to describe fracture development and design considerations for underground and surface mine structures. Analytical techniques based on empirical knowledge and supported by available theory and engineering practice are presented, including, for example: slope stability, underground structure and rock foundation design; the influences of ground water, rockbursts and backfill support on structural stability of excavations; and discussion of potential hazards associated with each. The operation and design of instrumentation used for rock mechanics studies are also discussed.",

In this course students will demonstrate that the practice of mine planning varies along a spectrum from long range planning through to short term planning with the distinguishing factor being the required level of detail in the mine plan. In the context of long term planning, students will study underground mine design principles such as mining method selection, mine design methodology, mine scheduling and mineral reserves. A progression towards short term planning will lead to the exploration of topics including underground drill and blast design, ground support requirements, ventilation, backfill and reconciliation. Modern mine planning practices involve the application of technology to facilitate mine design, optimization and scheduling. These techniques will be discussed and some of the tools being used in the mining industry will be used in this course.  Available Online.",
